# Sudoku
That's my first try to build a java project to realize with Git in version control.
Lately, I am curious about Sudoku .Maybe there is a way to manage challenging Sudoku puzzle and provide services to simplify the process of solving it.

Here is my plan.
(A simple process flow)

First, realize Sudoku puzzles store. 
  
  Database: MySQL
  Database Management: Navicat
  
  1\ design a workable form of data to store in Database
  2\ realize and map in java enitites
